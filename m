I installed SL10.1 today on a P3M laptop (Dell D600)
and it defaults to the "Powersave" scheme which includes
"Dynamic Frequency Scaling" (ondemand), so that is good.

However, by defaulit "Allow Throttling" is CHECKED
and Max %  is set to 50%.

Exactly what does this mean?
I looked in /proc/acpi/processor/*/throttling and the
laptop is still in T0.

Is there an easy way for me to modify the kernel to
convince the powersaved application that the system
does not support throttling?  I'm thinking that we've
given user-space too much rope and it has proceeded
to hang itself.

thanks,
