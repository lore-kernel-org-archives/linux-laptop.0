To be honest, this observation suprises me a little bit. We did some
measurements with userspace agains ondemand governor some time ago and did
not notice any big differences in the results between them. Well, these
tests are about 1 1/2 years ago, though, and there went some changes into
the kernel until now ;-)

Nevertheless, we adjust the sampling rate in any case and currently set it
to 333 milliseconds (that's configurable). We noticed if we use the
default ondemand setting, the ondemand governor increases the frequency
too often although there is not much to do which is also not helpful. But
333 milliseconds is maybe a bit too high, it's taken because of historical
reasons. This value _was_ the default interval of our main event loop. I
think I will lower it a bit.

Furthermore, we had some problems on multiprocessor systems in the past
(about 1/2 year ago) with the ondemand governor. After some time the
system was running (even some hours or even days) the machine locked up
hard. Thus, we set the userspace governor by default on those systems
where we never experienced such problems. At the moment I did only get one
similar report where the root cause is not clear. So I stick to the
ondemand governor in any case in newer releases. And such lockups are
really hard to reproduce and to debug.

Another argument was that speedstep_ich was not yet ready for ondemand
which it is now IIRC.

In current code, I always try to use the ondemand governor at first and if
that fails we automatically switch to the userspace implementation at
runtime. This way has the advantage that we always get a working cpu
frequency scaling support.. But it also has one big disadvantage, we do
not get reports about not working ondemand governor so maybe we simply did
not notice the improvements in this area. For our stable releases, I will
keep the current inplementation. For the unstable one, I will disable the
autoswitching code and if it still works good then for a few month, I will
remove the userspace implementation completely. It should not hurt to let
the code in for some time and remove the visible configuration option,
just to have fallback under strange circumstances.  Would this be ok with
you?

Yes, this is reasonable, indeen. Will do that. With p-states in this
context, you mean cpufreq here?

I'm not sure if I completely understand what you mean here. Do you mean
the so called "runtime device power management"?

If so, I fully agree with you. But I do not set a specific policy in the
powersave code explicitely for that feature. If the policy information
will go into the kernel, I will use and set this one, of course.
