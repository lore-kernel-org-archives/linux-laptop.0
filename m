Yes, measurements show that ondemand as improved
considerably since its initial implementation.
It continues to improve today, though there is now smaller room for improvement.

Also, the other important thing to meausre here is *response time* --
not throughput.  This will expose the benefits of switching quickly
via ondemand vs. slowly via userspace.
This is particularly important on interarctive workloads.

No, you'll not notice much, if any,  difference for course grain things
like doing a kernel build or running a steady-state server workload.

I have not observed the ondemand governor today switching up
more often than is helpful.

I speak for intel hardware, of course.
It might be that other hardware, which can not switch up and down
very quickly, not not benefit from ondemand and may be better
suited to userspace.

Go ahead and tune userspace to work optimally on systems that can't run ondemand.
Systems that are able to run ondemand should not be running userspace
at all.

It is important that this failure be root caused and this

speedstep-centrino and acpi-cpufreq support real p-states and can
can support ondemand.  (indeed, these two drivers need to be merged into a single driver)

While older systems will use speedstep-ich, I don't expect to see much
use for it on modern systems.  p4clockmod is just t-states,
and one could argue that it should not exist at all.

I don't know if the amd-specific drivers would work or not.
Last I heard their latency was too high, but maybe they've
fixed that.

There is a cpufreq architecture issue here here, of course.
the drivers make all the different states look the same
to the governors.  But P-states and T-states are not the same,
they are very different.

I think you'll need to keep the userspace backup scheme for systems
which have switching latency too high to load and run ondemand.

However, systems which can run ondemand, should never run userspace,
and providing userspace as an option on such systems is probably
not the right knob to present to administrators on those boxes.

throttling is always T-states.
cpufreq is usually p-states, but in the case of p4clockmod,
it is T-states also.  As I mentioned above, cpufreq is doing
you a dis-service by hiding the difference from you
and really need to be enhanced to know (and export)
the difference.

okay, great.
Yes, the kernel folks have known for years that this has to be done.
Hopefully progress will be made soon...
