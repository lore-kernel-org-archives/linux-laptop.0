I see -- my test platform changed from dual-core to single-core,
so I didn't see this issue before.

I understand, though I think it would be more practical to not
enable throttling by default on any system; and for systems
with cpufreq to not even advertise this option to users.

Also, I think something is broken today.
If I use the GUI to disable throttling in the Powersave scheme
and save, and then pull out the plug; a window with "watch
.../throttling"
shows that the system drops into T2, and then bounces back to T0.

I don't trust the application to keep its hands off this file,
so I think that I need a way to disable/remove that file.

thanks,
