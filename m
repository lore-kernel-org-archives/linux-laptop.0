It means that the powersaved throttles your CPU if there is no load and
dethrottles if there is load. It's that way already for several years and
I only got a report about performance loss on SMP systems, so we don't do
throttling by default on those systems.

I'm currently working on a solution to allow throttling only on systems
which don't support CPUfreq. At the point this thread came up, or a few
days later as we talked about it, I completely agreed with you. But at
that time we already had RC1 in regard to SUSE Linux 10.1, so there was no
possibility anymore to change such a default behaviour. For the unstable
powersave realeases, there will come up some changes soon, though.
