Agreed. We kept this already far too long without seeing a real gain.

I really don't see a possibility that powersaved could be the culprit in
this case. If it's disabled in /etc/powersave/scheme_powersave, well it
surely doesn't touch this file:

  bool ThrottleInterface::throttle(int percent)
  {
         if (!_throttling_supported
	     || !config_obj->current_scheme->ALLOW_THROTTLING) {
		return false;
         }
  ...
  }

If you can reproduce that it switches to T2 when you do a rcpowersaved
restart or on every unplug, it would actually be a bug which is worth
to be reported.
